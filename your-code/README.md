## Project Description
As a child I loved to play hangman - therefore, the choice was easy. The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word for the player to guess from a list of words. The game is over when:The guessing player completes the word or the number of free turns are all used.
## Rules
Have a student select a letter of the alphabet.
-If the letter is contained in the word/phrase, the student takes another turn (in total 6 possible trials) guessing a letter.
-If the letter is not contained in the word/phrase, the student can try again. The number of open trials will be reduced. 

The game continues until:
-the word/phrase is guessed (all letters are revealed)  - WINS
-all trials are used â€“ LOST

## Workflow

Prerequisites
-Alternative Interpreters / Notebooks (jupyter)
-Structure repository (Readme/main code file / gitignore)
-Single python main file to describe the workflow / commenting
 (welcome greetings/ creation of variables / Creation of while loop with all possible outcomes/ print results and adjust open trials)
-Version control
## Organization
How did you organize your work? Did you use any tools like a kanban board?
I used the trello board. Here I followed the 5 main principles of Kanban:
-classification of taks (to be done, doing, done)
-list the tasks
-priotize
-repriotize
-set the tasks to done

What does your repository look like? Explain your folder and file structure.
The repository follows a clean structure:
-.gitignore file which contains all files that you want to ignore. 
- Readme file describes the general project and the setup
- Mainfile which includes the python code
## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
